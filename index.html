      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of computing. With a GPA of 4.8/5.0 and coursework in machine learning, algorithms, optimization, and data science, I thrive at the intersection of technical rigor and real-world impact.
        My experiences range from machine learning research at the MIT Energy Initiative to developing quantum-based image processing methods at Arizona State University. I’ve also led hands-on projects like MIT Pokerbots, where I applied strategic modeling and algorithms to competitive gameplay.
        Beyond research, I’ve served as a lab assistant, helping new students navigate programming challenges, and worked in industry as an associate consultant, contributing to database systems and vendor communication. I actively engage in professional development through groups like The CRWN and the MIT Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program.
        Passionate about building accessible, data-driven solutions, I’m always looking to collaborate on impactful tech and research projects.

        <li><strong>Analyzing Distributed Energy Resource Penetration and Database Creation</strong> – As the energy grid undergoes rapid decarbonization, distributed energy resources (DERs)—such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles—are becoming essential to reducing emissions and meeting climate goals. However, the transition is hindered by significant gaps in data coverage, quality, and accessibility. Many datasets lack the resolution or completeness needed to model DERs effectively across diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts. These limitations affect researchers’ and policymakers’ ability to simulate scenarios, optimize grid planning, and ensure equitable energy access.
Moreover, privacy concerns, proprietary utility practices, and cybersecurity issues exacerbate data scarcity, leaving underserved communities especially vulnerable to being excluded from clean energy planning. Without granular, accessible data, it becomes difficult to forecast DER growth and deployment patterns—key to building a resilient and inclusive energy system. My project tackles these challenges by creating a robust, well-documented, and open-source DER database and applying statistical and machine learning techniques to fill data gaps, reveal adoption trends, and support the equitable integration of DERs across the U.S.
